Project Marilyn RFC
===================

RFC
---
The purpose of this RFC is to solicit public involvement in the crafting of PM. After a final round 
of editing by the project lead, the RFC (minus this section) will be presented to the indysci dot org 
board for approval as the offical PM proposal. Questions about PM are encouraged, we will be putting 
together a FAQ that addresses issues and concerns that may arise, some of which we may not have 
anticipated yet.


Summary
-------
Project Marilyn (PM) is a nonprofit venture to raise money using the crowdfunding mechanism to bring 
several anticancer drug candidates through preclinical trials. Unlike most pharmaceutical research, 
the candidates brought forward by PM will *not be patented* and instead, *released to the public domain*, 
so that ultimately manufacturers can produce these candidates inexpensively without licencing costs. 
The project lead, Isaac Yonemoto, was involved in producing and conducting initial tests on the parent 
compound, 9-deoxysibiromycin (9DS).

Background
----------
Sibiromycin was discovered in the last century by researchers in Siberia. It is a toxic compound produced 
by soil bacteria; it arrests DNA replication and therefore has potential as an anticancer chemotherapeutic. 
Research on sibiromycin was abandoned when it was discovered to also be cardiotoxic. Later research 
identified a single oxygen atom that is likely to be the cause of this cardiotoxicity. Dr. Barbara Gerratana 
devised a method to produce analogs of sibiromycin lacking this oxygen atom, hence 9-deoxysibiromycin. 
Initial tests indicate that as designed, 9DS is less cardiotoxic than the parent sibiromycin, and surprisingly, 
more potent against cancer cell lines in vitro.

Dr. Gerratana departed from her position as an academic research lead, and once again research on the 
sibiromycin family was abandoned. Project Marilyn picks up where this research left off, taking advantage of 
the expiration of the patentability of 9DS with the intent of producing more analogs and releasing these, 
too, to the public domain. An open-access version of the publication reporting 9DS is available.

What remains to be done is to bring 9DS through further preclinical trials, this includes animal studies 
such as a pharmacokinetics study and a xenograft study to measure efficacy against select cancer lines and 
suggested dosage if it goes to human trials. Pharmaceutical development is often ‘a numbers game’. To 
improve the likelihood of success, PM seeks to produce analogs of 9DS that can also be subjected to preclinical 
experimentation, so that the ‘best candidate’ can be put forth for the clinic.

Project Lead Qualifications
---------------------------
Isaac Yonemoto earned his PhD in chemistry from The Scripps Research Institute, for research on protein folding 
dynamics. Subsequently, he performed postdoctoral research under the supervision of Barbara Gerratana, gaining 
firsthand experience in the production, analytical verification, and handling of sibiromycin and analogs. After 
this, he performed postdoctoral research at the J. Craig Venter Institute, gaining experience in synthetic 
biology techniques. A full CV is available here.

Full Scientific Description
---------------------------
A full scientific description is available for examination here.

Fundraising
-----------
Fundraising will begin on January 7th, 2014 and last till February 7th, 2014, barring extensions. To improve 
the likelihood of success (including a small budgetary margin), the fundraising minimum “tilt value” will be 
750,000 USD. A first stretch goal will be announced and described at 1,000,000 USD and will tilt at 1,250,000 
USD. A second stretch goal will be announced and described at 1,500,000 USD and will tilt at 1,750,000 USD. 
If enough funds are collected to reveal a stretch goal (i.e. at the 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 levels), then the 
fundraising period will be extended one week (i.e. to February 14th, and February 21st, respectively). Although 
we will not ‘reveal’ the stretch goals at the moment, both stretch goals will be projects dedicated to the 
treatment of cancer, and will be well-posed to share laboratory infrastructure with the primary PM objective. 
All pharmaceutical candidates developed for the primary or stretch goals will not be patented and will be 
released to the public domain.

Success Criteria
----------------
PM will be considered to have succeded if three sibiromycin derivatives (including 9DS) have completed a 
suite of preclinical trials, to include NCI-60 screen, pharmacokinetic studies and xenograft studies.

Secondary Objectives
--------------------
PM will also pursue some secondary objectives which will not affect the determination of success but may in 
the short term ease the production of sibiromycin analogs for preclinical testing and in the long term improve 
the likelihood of regulatory approval or commercial viability. These include, but are not limited to: development 
of producer strains, improvement of growth and harvesting conditions for producer strains, and improvement of 
purification process.

Scientific Advisor
------------------
PM has not at the moment designated scientific advisor(s), we are soliciting recommendations for researchers 
with two years of experience willing to give ~10h a year to provide independent oversight for the project. 
The advisor will be responsible for issuing an interim go/no go decision, and be responsible for determining 
if the project was successful at its conclusion. Compensation may be available. Especially welcome are 
scientists interested in supporting public domain pharmaceuticals, scientists with drug development experience, 
or scientists with clinical research experience in the field of oncology.

Timeline
--------
Detailed PM timeline is available as a separate document here.

Budget
------
Detailed PM budgets are available as a separate document here

Summary: Budgets for 750,000 USD, 1,250,000 USD, and 1,750,000 USD are presented. Note that higher fundraising 
will result in increased budgetary margins. Also note that the 1,750,000 USD stretch goals involves 
experimentation over a longer timeframe than the other two fundraising outcomes. Employees will not be 
penalized if the project concludes earlier as a result of achieving the project objectives.

Surplus Budget
--------------
Upon conclusion of the project, the use of the surplus budget will depend on the total amount of funds raised 
by crowdfunding:

* 750,000~1,000,000 USD, the surplus budget will be transferred to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cancer research hospital, such as City of Hope hospital.  
* 100,000~1,250,000 USD, no more than half of the surplus budget will be used to pilot the first stretch goal with the intent to generate data to re-pitch the first stretch goal pending the success of PM primary objective. The remainder will be transferred to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cancer research hospital.
* 1,250,000~1,500,000 USD, the surplus budget will be transferred to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cancer research hospital.
* > 1,500,000 USD no more than half of the surplus budget will be used to pilot or continue the first and second stretch goals. The remainder will be transferred to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cancer research hospital.

10% time
--------
Acknowledging that freedom to pursue tangential or unrelated science is good for the emotional well-being of the 
scientist and improves the scientist’s mental faculties, postdoctoral researchers (but not technicians, without 
approval of the project lead) will be encouraged to pursue “10% time” projects which may or may not be related 
to PM, if funds are available. Funds for reagents, equipment, and supplies for 10% time will derive from the 
indysci general budget, and not the PM budget, unless a compelling connection to PM can be argued. The project 
lead will be responsible for making this determination. Salaries for 10% time will not be prorated.

Other Projects
--------------
The project lead will reserve the right to pursue at most one other primary scientific project outside of the scope 
of PM and the PM stretch goals. If such a project is funded, then the lead salary will be prorated to 50%.
